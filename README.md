These are the below three coursera projects solution and you can find the solution in the repository.
Facial Expression Recognition using Keras                                                                                                 
•	Build and trained a CNN in Keras using OpenCV to draw face boundary for automatic face detection  
•	Deployed the trained model to FLASK web interface and performed real-time facial expression detection
