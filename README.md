These are the below three coursera projects solution and you can find the solution in the repository.
Facial Expression Recognition using Keras                                                                                                 
•	Build and trained a CNN in Keras using OpenCV to draw face boundary for automatic face detection  
•	Deployed the trained model to FLASK web interface and performed real-time facial expression detection

Unsupervised Machine-Learning for Customer Market Segmentation                                             
•	Obtained optimal no. of clusters using elbow method and performed KMeans for segmentation
•	Applied PCA technique to implement dimensionality reduction and data visualization

NLP: Twitter Sentiment Analysis |                                                                                                                    
•	Created a pipeline for data cleaning to remove stop words, punctuations and performed tokenization
•	Applied a Naïve Bayes Classifier and assessed the performance of trained model
